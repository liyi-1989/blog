abstract = "J. Rissanen modified Markov Chains of memory length n by assuming that the
current state of a string is independent of the symbols in its past preceding a context of the
length which is a function of the past itself. He developed a construction algorithm of contexts
stochastic suffix tree for compressing stationary time series and proved its consistency.
Rissanenâ€™s Variable memory Length Markov Chains (VLMC) were formally applied for classifying
non-stationary proteins by G. Bejerano and others by training their VLMC models.
In this paper, we apply VLMC training of presumably stationary parts of piece-wise stationary
time series for testing homogeneity of longer regions and, if homogeneity is rejected, for
identifying most discriminating contexts."
